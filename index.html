                Hello! My name is Christopher Gauthier. Welcome to my page. Lets go over a little bit about me.
                I was born in 1991 at Concord hospital and grew up in Henniker NH. This is the only Henniker on earth
                and
                is home to local attractions
                like Pats Peak, Sonny's Pizza & the Pancake House. As a child I attended the local elementary school -
                Henniker Community School.
                After elementary school i attended
                high school at John Stark Regional - this is located in Weare, NH which is the neighboring town to
                henniker. I attended John Stark from 2006 - 2010.
            </p>

            I have a few random skills. The first one is being able to solve a rubik's cube. I learned this in
            highschool to prove to myself that I could figure it out.
            The second one is the ability to spin books & binder (anything flat and normal sized) on my finger. I
            learned this while studying for the Series 7 examination while i was bored.
            The final random skill I have is being able to juggle. I taught myself this from a juggling book.
            (DISCLAIMER: I am not very good at juggling.)
        </p>

            My thoughts on this project: This is challenging - CSS has been a lot of trial and error for me. Sometimes
            i think i understand what i am doing
            but then a style i apply does not work or works in a different way. I am having fun learning more each day!
